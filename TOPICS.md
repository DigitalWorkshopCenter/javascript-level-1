- FIRST PROGRAM
  - introduce
    - console.prompt
    - console.alert

- HOMEWORK
  - make a program that prompts for your age
  - convert the value to a number
  - then compare the number to the legal drinking age
  - display a message showing if you can drink alcohol
  - BONUS POINTS: prompt the user for their

    - fav non-alcoholic drink
    - age
    - then display a message containing
      - the name
      - the age
      - the appropriate drink

- introduce functions
  - take the earlier examples and implement them using functions

- introduce objects
  - objects are data
  - return to bag analogy
  - primitive vs reference
  - re-assign variables
  - mutation
  - dynamically add / remove properties
- null & undefined
